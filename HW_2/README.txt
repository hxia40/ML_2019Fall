Machine Learning - 2019 Fall

Assignment 2

Use this Dropbox link to find the code and dataset files, and other associated files needed:


https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tcyqnync50xmp7o/AAAJH-kokjYgRyLp9_gAO7GRa?dl=0


====================== Useful Information ====================

The code file:
	HW2_part1.py
	HW2_part2.py

The dataset files:
	Epileptic_Seizure_Recognition.csv

Folders:
	data
	fig
	data_adv
	ANN_curve

How to use it:

The code is written in Python 3.6, relevant packages will need to be installed before running the code. 	
The version of these packages are:
	
	morose 1.2.0
	numpy - 1.17.2
	pandas - 0.25.1
	matplotlib - 3.1.1
	scikit-learn - 0.21.3
	scipy 1.3.1

To run the code, copy all the above-mentioned dataset files (*.csv), the code (*.py), and all the three folders (i.e. copy everything from the provided dropbox folder) into same folder. After that, simply run the code. 

Note: 

It may take up to 24 hours to finish running all the code. To facilitate the reviewing process, the figures (*.png) and the corresponding data (*.txt) are included in their respective folders. You do not need the contents in these folders to run the code (however you do need these empty folders to exist to run the code).

If needed, the code can be run in sections by choice. Just comment out the sections that are not of interest, only run the rest. 

There are two sections for both HW_2_part1.py and HW_2_part1.py. 

The sections are:
For HW2_part1.py:

	Section 1: parameter optimization. 
	This section will generate figure and data into two folders: fig and data

	Section 2: algorithm test based on different size
	This section will generate data into the folders: data_adv

For HW2_part2.py:
	Section 1: parameter optimization. 
	This section will generate figure and data into the folder: ANN_curve

	Section 2: inter-algorithm comparasion
	This section will directly print the data out.


To facilitate the reviewing process, figures and data files used to write the report are included in the sub-folder "figures_and_data". These files are:

	Figure 1.png
	Figure 2.png
	Figure 3.png
	Figure 4.png
	Figure 5.png
