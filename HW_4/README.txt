Machine Learning - 2019 Fall

Assignment 4

Use this Dropbox link to find the code and dataset files, and other associated files needed:


https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pboc2yqva6753d5/AACT7bYKVqBe3U8cOPciCH5ha?dl=0


====================== Useful Information ====================

The code file:
	forex_env.py
	HX_anytrading.py
	HX_main.py
	HX_maze.py
	HX_policy_iteration.py
	HX_QLearner.py
	HX_value_iteration.py
	stocks_env.py
	trading_env.py


The dataset files:
	SPY.csv, 
	
Folders:
	figures_and_data
	

How to use it:

The code is written in Python 3.6, relevant packages will need to be installed before running the code. 	
The version of these packages are:

	numpy - 1.16.4
	pandas - 0.24.2
	matplotlib - 2.2.4
	gym -  0.15.3
	gym-anytrading - 1.0.0
	future - 0.18.2
	pyglet - 1.3.2

To run the code, copy all the above-mentioned dataset files (*.csv), the codes (*.py) into same folder. Run HX_value_iteration.py, HX_policy_iteration.py, and HX_main.py for Vaue Iteration, Policy Iteration, and Q-learner, respectively. 


Note: 

It may take up to 12 hours to finish running all the code. To facilitate the reviewing process, the figures (*.png) and the corresponding data (*.xlsx) are included in the folder 'figures_and_data' 

If needed, the code can be run in sections by choice. Just comment out the sections that are not of interest, only run the rest.
