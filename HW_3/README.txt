I want to obtain hands-on skills on database-related projects. Especially, I want to learn about how to handle data, and how to obtain information from it. I am a biomedical engineer work a university. In my research work, I obtain data on a daily basis. However, the more I work, the more I feel that lack the skill of handling/mining data properly. Thus, I need a 'guru' role that can not only teach my skills etc., but more importantly, I need to figure out how to 'get into the business', i.e. what is the state-of-the-art, what do people in the data-business care about, etc. Udacity provides a platform, including the mentor and communities in the nano-degree that I can utilize to “get into the business”.


As mentioned above, I am a biomedical engineer in university. I design devices separate blood components for decrease screening and transfusion. I have academic paper published. (e.g. H Xia, et. al. Scientific Reports 6, 35943). I am interested in developing my data science expertise, thus on have enrolled in online masters at Gatech. The data-handling skills that I can learn from Udacity will enable me to do several things. E.g. Come up with new ideas and designs on biomedical devices, fine-tune existing device using existing data (In my research group are generating data in a fairly quick manner, but are not able to analyze them throughly, except calculating for simple average, etc), and gain more publications with existing data. Additionally, the data-mining skills will increase my understanding on medical device designing,  and could potentially help me to move from academia to industry.
