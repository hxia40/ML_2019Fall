====================== Useful Information ====================

The code file:
	HW3_part1.py
	HW3_part2.py
	HW3_part3.py
	HW3_part4.py
	HW3_part5.py

The dataset files:
	fashion-mnist_train_minor.csv, 
	fashion-mnist_test_minor.csv, 
	Epileptic_Seizure_Recognition.csv

Folders:
	figures_and_data

How to use it:

The code is written in Python 2.7, relevant packages will need to be installed before running the code. 	
The version of these packages are:

	numpy - 1.16.4
	pandas - 0.24.2
	matplotlib - 2.2.4
	scikit-learn - 0.20.4

To run the code, copy all the above-mentioned dataset files (*.csv), the codes (*.py), and  the folder (i.e. copy everything from the provided dropbox folder) into same folder. After that, simply run the code. The five .py files correspond to the five parts of the assignments respectively. 

Note: 

It may take up to 12 hours to finish running all the code (especially, the code for part 2 takes about 8 hours to run). To facilitate the reviewing process, figures and data files used to write the report are included in the sub-folder "figures_and_data". These files are:

	Figure 2.png
	Figure 3.png
	data_plot.xlsx
	Figures.pptx
